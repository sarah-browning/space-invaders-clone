Game Preparation Notes:

Space Invaders Gameplay
		Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen
	and fires at aliens overhead. The aliens begin as five rows of eleven that move left and right as a group, shifting
	downward each time they reach a screen edge. The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens by shooting them. While the player
	has three lives, the game ends immediately if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen.
		The aliens attempt to destroy the player's cannon by firing projectiles. The laser cannon is partially protected by
	stationary defense bunkers which are gradually destroyed from the top by the aliens and, if the player fires when beneath
	one, the bottom.
		As aliens are defeated, their movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating all the aliens brings another
	wave which starts lower, a loop which can continue endlessly. A special "mystery ship" will occasionally
	move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed.
	
Tips from Darren:
	- if say you use the space bar to fire projectiles, using same label to fire, you'll have issues with two simultaneous threads
	- the more you fire, the more you get rendering issues; thread pools could solve the issue
	- track # of bullets visible/active and create an array of labels for the projectiles and loop through the array
	  to find out which, if any, are visible
